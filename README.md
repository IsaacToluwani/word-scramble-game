# Isaac's Scramble Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features
* Random Word Scrambling: Each word is shuffled uniquely.
* User Input Validation: Case-insensitive input handling.


## How to Play

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
1. A scrambled word appears on the screen
2. Enter your guess in the input field and submit.
3. If correct, a new scrambled word appears; if incorrect, try again.
4. Use the Hint button if needed (costs points).
5. Skip a word if it's too difficult (costs more points).
6. The game ends when all words have been attempted.
